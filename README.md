# excel-csv-uploader
Django Application for File Upload and Data Processing: A Django-based web application that allows users to upload Excel or CSV files, reads the uploaded data, and displays it on the webpage using Pandas for efficient data handling. This project demonstrates the integration of file upload, data validation, and dynamic content rendering in Django.
We successfully developed a Django web application that allows users to upload Excel (.xlsx) and CSV (.csv) files. This application processes and displays uploaded data directly on a web page, making it useful for data analysis and visualization.

Key Technologies:

Django: Python web framework for the backend.
Python & Pandas: For data handling and processing.
HTML/CSS & Bootstrap: For the front-end design.
Development Highlights:

Project Setup: Created a Django project and app, configured settings, and integrated the necessary libraries.
File Upload Form: Utilized Django forms to accept file uploads.
Views & Data Processing: Implemented views using Pandas to read and process Excel/CSV files, displaying results on a web page.
HTML Templates: Designed templates to upload files (upload.html) and display data (display.html).
URL Routing: Set up URLs to handle navigation and file processing.
Testing: Successfully tested the application on a local server.
Conclusion: The application efficiently handles file uploads and data processing. Future improvements could include data validation, storing uploaded files in a database, and enabling data downloads in various formats.
